<p>If you go to CPRS right now, you will see this on the patient selection screen if you click on <code>Wards</code> in the <code>Patient Selection</code> area. Our objective in this section and the next section is to set-up a hospital in our VistA system with a couple of wards.</p>

<p>The first three steps take place in Fileman. The rest of the steps take place in various menus. If you want, you can set-up a real or PDF printer. This is covered extensively at Vistapedia: <a href="http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/Setting_up_a_VISTA_Printer">http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/Setting_up_a_VISTA_Printer</a>. If you don't set one up, you can just set the printer to <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>FOIA comes with a broken file in 213.9. In order to be able to edit it, we have to set it up manually. From direct mode, we do some fixes; and then we go to Fileman to edit it.</p>

<p>The next step is somewhat necessary but very tedious: You need to decide which specialities you will admit patients for; and deactivate all the other specialties. You can also add new ones. For this example, I will use Cardiology and Dermatology specialties and deactivate the rest (I will only show two deactivations). Please note that in real life you won't have such simple specializations: You may need Cardiology Observation, Cardiology Step-Down, Cardiology ICU, Cardiac Surgery, etc.</p>
