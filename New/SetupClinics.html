<p>If you have reached this point, it means that you have finished <a href="./InitializeVistA.html">VistA Initialization</a>.</p>
<p>If you logged in to CPRS, and tried to create an encounter (a.k.a. Visit), by clicking on this:</p>

<img src="images/SetupClinics/select_visit.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>You will see the following:</p>

<p>We have users populated; but we do not have any clinics to choose for a visit location.</p>
<p>Before we get started, we need to define what "clinic" means. It's not a physical building; nor it is a specific room or wing in a hospital. It really stands for an administrive unit in a specific speciality at which patients can be scheduled for appointments. "Clinic" in English also means the entire building in which these specialties are housed; but that's not what it means in VistA.</p>
<p>Examples of VistA Clinics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardiology Clinic</li>
<li>Dr. Boson's Clinic (single physician clinic)</li>
<li>Dermatology Clinic</li>
<li>Immunization Update Clinic</li>
<li>Public Nurse Visits Clinic</li>
</ul>
<p>In order for us to create a new clinic, we need to log-in as a system manager into the "roll and scroll" and set-up a new clinic. To get to the menu, you need to go from:</p>
<div class="code"><code>
 Core Applications &rarr; Scheduling Manager's Menu &rarr; Supervisor Menu &rarr; Set up a Clinic</code></div>
<p>Here's a walk through the menu system showing you getting there:</p>

Select Supervisor Menu <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: <strong>Set</strong> up a Clinic</code></div>
<p>We should technically create form letters for the clinic using the option <code>Enter/Edit Letters</code> before we start, but we will leave that as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>These fields are <em>required</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>CLINIC NAME</li>
<li>SERVICE</li>
<li>NON-COUNT CLINIC</li>
<li>STOP CODE NUMBER</li>
<li>DEFAULT APPOINTMENT TYPE</li>
<li>ALLOWABLE CONSECUTIVE NO-SHOWS</li>
<li>MAX # DAYS FOR FUTURE BOOKING</li>
<li>MAX # DAYS FOR AUTO-REBOOK</li>
<li>OVERBOOKS/DAY MAXIMUM</li>
<li>LENGTH OF APP'T</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be asked first a bunch of questions, then you will come to a section called "Availability" in which you set-up the number of patient slots for your clinic. We will pause there for an explanation of the syntax.</p>
<p>Text in italics is commentary. As always, ? and ?? will show you more information on each field.</p>
<div class="code"><code>Select CLINIC NAME: <strong>CARDIOLOGY</strong>
  Are you adding 'CARDIOLOGY' as a new HOSPITAL LOCATION? No// <strong>Y</strong>  (Yes)

<i>You must type N here for proper crediting.</i>
NON-COUNT CLINIC? (Y OR N): <strong>N</strong>  NO

<i>The next two questions are important: The STOP CODE is used for statistics;
the DEFAULT APPOINTMENT TYPE is used by Scheduling</i>
STOP CODE NUMBER: <strong>CARDIOLOGY</strong>       303
DEFAULT APPOINTMENT TYPE: REGULAR//  <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>

<i>Action profiles are printed sheets of paper containing a patient's 
medications. No, I don't think we want them.</i>
REQUIRE ACTION PROFILES?: YES// <strong>N</strong>  NO

<i>If we created letters, we would put them here</i>
NO SHOW LETTER: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
PRE-APPOINTMENT LETTER: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
CLINIC CANCELLATION LETTER: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
APPT. CANCELLATION LETTER: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>

<i>The next five quetions are only used if clerks check out patients (check 
out = do some work after the visit is done)</i>
ASK FOR CHECK IN/OUT TIME: <strong>N</strong>  NO
Select PROVIDER: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
DEFAULT TO PC PRACTITIONER?: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
Select DIAGNOSIS: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
WORKLOAD VALIDATION AT CHK OUT: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>

<i>The next few questions have to do with configuration of scheduling 
patients for the clinic</i>
ALLOWABLE CONSECUTIVE NO-SHOWS: <strong>5</strong> 
MAX # DAYS FOR FUTURE BOOKING: <strong>180</strong>
HOUR CLINIC DISPLAY BEGINS: <strong>9</strong>
START TIME FOR AUTO REBOOK: <strong>13</strong>
MAX # DAYS FOR AUTO-REBOOK: <strong>60</strong>
SCHEDULE ON HOLIDAYS?: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
CREDIT STOP CODE: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
PROHIBIT ACCESS TO CLINIC?: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
PHYSICAL LOCATION: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
PRINCIPAL CLINIC: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>
OVERBOOKS/DAY MAXIMUM: <strong>2</strong>

<i>The next field is to put in instructions for clerks (e.g. make sure 
patients get LDL done before seeing Dr. Lewis)</i>
Select SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong>

<i>The next 3 questions deal with how long appointments are, and how to 
display the appointment increments</i>
LENGTH OF APP'T: <strong>30</strong>
VARIABLE APP'NTMENT LENGTH: <strong>Y</strong>  YES, VARIABLE LENGTH
DISPLAY INCREMENTS PER HOUR: 4// <strong>2</strong>  30-MIN </code></div>
<p>The next section needs some explanation before we show it: The scheduling interface VistA has displays appointment slots like this:</p>
<div class="code"><code>[1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1] [1]</code></div>
<p>This means that every time period (here, 30 minutes) has 1 appointment available. If you have multiple physicians in the CARDIOLOGY clinic, you can have more than 1 slot available. Let's say you have 3 physicians. Then you can set-up your slots to look like this:</p>
<div class="code"><code>[5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5]</code></div>
<p>When you use up one slot, what's left is 4 in the specific slot:</p>
<div class="code"><code>[5] [4] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5] [5]</code></div>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that you book a clinic by day of week, even though it doesn't look like it. You actually put a day, and it will ask you if it can use this pattern for all future appointments for this day of week. I wrote this document on a Monday, so putting "T" will stand for Mondays, and "T+1" will stand for Tuesdays, etc.</p>
<p>You are asked for "TIME" multiple times. The idea is that you can go from--say--9am to 12pm, and then from 1pm to 5pm.</p>
<p>With these explanations behind us, here is a simple set-up:</p>
<div class="code"><code>AVAILABILITY DATE: <strong>T</strong>  (MAY 07, 2018)
