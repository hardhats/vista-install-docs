<p>Attributions: Original instructions by Fil Beza and Nancy Anthracite; this set has been updated by Sam Habiel. Last updated in January 2019.</p>
<p>If you have reached this point, it means that you have finished <a href="./InstallCache.html">Install Cache</a>; or <a href="./InstallGTM.html">Install GT.M/YottaDB</a> and <a href="./InstallVistAOnGTM.html">Install VistA on GT.M/YottaDB</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gt.myottadb-note">GT.M/YottaDB Note</h2>
<p>YottaDB is a fork of GT.M. In VistA, everything that says GT.M will work equally well for YottaDB. When running <code>^ZTMGRSET</code> or <code>^DINIT</code>, choose GT.M on Unix for YottaDB.</p>
<h2 id="getting-into-the-direct-mode-aka-programmer-mode">Getting into the Direct Mode (AKA Programmer Mode)</h2>
<p>Before there were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPLs</a>, Mumps always has had something called Direct Mode, also known as Programmer Mode, which is a simplified REPL. Normally, end users are not allowed to access Programmer Mode as it is essentially like running as root on a Unix System.</p>
<p>To connect to VISTA and start configuring it, you need a terminal emulator that emulates VT-100, VT-220, VT-320 or VT-52. By default, most terminal emulators do that already, but you cannot use the rxvt terminal emulator.</p>
<p>If you modified your $TERM, you need to make sure it's either <code>xterm</code> or <code>ansi</code>. Others generally will work, but I am sure of these two.</p>
<p>To get into Direct Mode using Cache, on Windows you need to right click on the Cache Cube and choose Terminal. If you have a licensed version of Cache, you can also use Telnet to connect to the Terminal. Please note that Windows Telnet does not emulate VT-200 series terminals properly, so you may have some issues with it. If you want to use Telnet, I recommend downloading PuTTY (<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>) or TeraTerm (<a href="https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en">https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en</a>).</p>
<p>If you use PuTTY, change the function key bindings so that they behave like VT-100+. See here: <a href="https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-funkeys">https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.58/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-funkeys</a>.</p>
<p>On a Mac, Terminal is a fully featured terminal emulator. You may wish to use System Preferences to configure the function keys to send Function commands, rather than dimming your screen or muting your volume. Otherwise, you have to use FN all the time to override the function keys (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204436">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204436</a>).</p>
<p>On Linux, you can use any Terminal Emulator program with the exception of rxvt. You can actually even use PuTTY on Linux. In some emulators, F1 may be bound to do help. You need to unmap that in the Terminal application (<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/37313/how-do-i-deactivate-f1-and-f10-keybindings-in-gnome-terminal">http://askubuntu.com/questions/37313/how-do-i-deactivate-f1-and-f10-keybindings-in-gnome-terminal</a>).</p>
<p>If a VistA system was installed by you or somebody else in the "Cloud", you will almost certainly need to use Secure Shell (SSH) to log in. SSH is a protocol written in the mid-90s to replace Telnet. It's the standard of connecting to other computers on the Cloud. Nobody can see the traffic inside of SSH, whereas Telnet is just plain text. The ssh client comes installed by default in all Unices; on Windows, you can use PuTTY or TeraTerm.</p>
<p>After you open your terminal emulator, do the following:</p>
<p>If your VistA is hosted on a remote server, connect to that first.</p>
<p>On Cache on Linux or Mac, you need to run <code>ccontrol list</code> to find your instance name, and then run <code>csession &lt;instance name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>On GT.M/YottaDB, you need to source your environment file. If you followed this guide, it should be in /var/db/&lt;name&gt; as env.vista. To source, type <code>. /var/db/&lt;name&gt;/env.vista</code> (The dot is all by itself, followed by a space). Then type <code>mumps -dir</code> to go into direct mode.</p>
<p>You will see something like this:</p>
<pre>GTM></pre>
<p>or in Cache:</p>
<pre>USER></pre>
<p>If you are in Cache, you need to switch namespaces. (If you don't remember, type ? to see your choices.)</p>

<h2 id="note-to-gt.myottadb-users">Note to GT.M/YottaDB Users</h2>
<p>Due to the fact that Cache does not enforce the M standard as strictly, many illegal instructions have been incorporated into VistA code. In addition, neither Cache nor GT.M/YottaDB is fully M95 standards compliant. As a result, ensuring that new code supports both systems is something of a game. For these reasons, the hardhats community maintains fixes for these routines and, when possible, sends the fixes back to the VA. In the future, the OSEHRA repositories will contain the fixes so that end users don't have to download the code and fix it themselves.</p>
<p>The WorldVistA distribution of VistA already includes the below fixes.</p>
<p>If you downloaded vxVistA or FOIA VistA, you need to copy the routines from this repository to your routines directory: <a href="https://github.com/shabiel/Kernel-GTM">https://github.com/shabiel/Kernel-GTM</a>. Here's how to do it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="fu">wget</span> https://github.com/shabiel/Kernel-GTM/releases/download/XU-8.0-10004/virgin_install.zip</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="fu">unzip</span> virgin_install.zip -d /path/to/database/r/</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This fixes the Kernel. There are some small fixes needed in random places in VistA, a total of about 5 routines. The fixes can be found in this repo: <a href="https://github.com/shabiel/foia-vista-fixes">https://github.com/shabiel/foia-vista-fixes</a>. You can get it like this</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="fu">wget</span> https://github.com/shabiel/foia-vista-fixes/archive/master.zip -O foia-vista-fixes.zip</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>$ <span class="fu">unzip</span> -j foia-vista-fixes.zip *.m -d /path/to/database/r/</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="note-to-cache-users">Note to Cache Users</h2>
<p>The evaluation version of Cache won't let you run more than one foreground process and 20 background processes. You can certainly configure VistA, but don't try to run the RPC broker. A friend wasted a lot of my time because he had an evaluation version and couldn't start the RPC broker. You may also need to restart Cache repeatedly, as it sometimes "forgets" that you logged off.</p>
<h2 id="commands-and-what-they-mean-a-short-m-primer">Commands and what they mean (a short M primer)</h2>

<h2 id="vista-text-mode-conventions">VistA Text Mode Conventions</h2>
<p>There are a few confusing conventions that outsiders don't understand right away. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>//</code> means that the preceding text is the default. If you press enter, you will accept it.</li>
<li><code>Replace</code> means that the existing text is long and you can edit it. Typing <code>...</code> means that you will replace the entire thing;</li>
<li><code>END</code> appends to the end. You can also use <code>...</code> to signify a range between two elements in the existing text. You can also enter a unique segment of the text, press enter, and at the with prompt put in what you want to replace that bit of text with. If you don't type anything in, it deletes that part of the text.</li>
<li><code>@</code> deletes an item.</li>
<li><code>^</code> usually lets you quit what you are in the middle of.</li>
<li><code>^FIELD NAME</code> lets you jump to a field while editing other fields. You may be blocked, depending on what the programmer decided to allow.</li>
<li><code>?</code> Short Help. Typically it tells you that you need to type a number or text.</li>
<li><code>??</code> More Help. Should tell you what the field you are filling does. In the menu system, show all menus with what security keys they need.</li>
<li><code>???</code> In the menu system, display help for each immediate submenu.</li>
<li><code>????</code> In the menu system, display help for current menu.</li>
<li><code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> key is the main navigation key in VistA. Typing it after an entry enters that entry; typing when nothing is entered will move you forward or up, depending on the context.</li>
<li><code>Select &lt;item&gt;</code> Whenever you see select, you can select or add an item; after that, you can edit it.</li>
<li><code>Spacebar &lt;enter&gt;</code> Most of the time, VistA remembers the last entry you made for a particular field. To make the same entry again, do spacebar enter.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="begin-to-set-up-the-vista-system">Begin to Set Up the VistA System</h1>
<h2 id="before-you-start">Before you Start</h2>
<p>You need to either invent or be given a few pieces of data:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are you going to call your Hospital or Clinic?</li>
<li>What's your station number? If you use VISTA or RPMS deployed by VA, IHS, or an external vendor; they will assign you your station number. Otherwise, pick a number from 130 to 199; or 971 to 999. These numbers are not used by the VA in VistA. In this guide, we will use 999.</li>
<li>What's your domain name? If you have a domain, use it; otherwise, invent one like <code>WWW.HABIEL.NAME</code>.</li>
<li>What's your parent domain? If you are not part of VA or IHS, you can use OSEHRA Forum: <code>FORUM.OSEHRA.ORG</code>.</li>
<li>Are you running on Cache vs GT.M/YottaDB; and what operating system you are running on? If you followed this guide from the very beginning, you would certainly know; but day to day users of VistA have no idea actually what it is running on.</li>
<li>What port number will you have VistA listen on for the RPC Broker? By convention, it's either 9000, 9200, or 9211.</li>
<li>What's the maximum number of processes that you will allow at once on a VistA system? Today (2016), commodity hardware (a good laptop, for example), can handle up to 200 concurrent processes. I usually set my test instances with a maximum of 30 processes, which is the number I use below.</li>
<li>What's your DNS Server? If you don't know, just use 8.8.8.8.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the configuration items below are taken from a system that may have had these entries previously created. If what you see on your screen doesn't exactly match what you see here, you can reply to Fileman with "Y" when adding a new entry; and skip past the fields that are indented by pressing <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code>. What matters in the end is that the final entry matches what is typed here.</p>
<h2 id="ztmgrset">ZTMGRSET</h2>
<p>The routine ZTMGRSET defines VistA global variables and saves system wide M routines that are M and OS specific. We need to kill ^%ZOSF to make sure we don't have old answers here; and sometimes having ^%ZOSF when you have just switched M implementations causes a catch 22 problem. The text scrape below is for GT.M/YottaDB; the one for Cache follows it.</p>

<p>Also run D ^ZUSET to choose the correct version of ZU, the key login routine for the roll and scroll portions of VistA (GT.M/YottaDB shown).</p>

This routine will rename the correct routine to ZU for you.

<h2 id="device-configuration">Device Configuration</h2>
<p>Next is to set-up 4 devices: NULL, CONSOLE, VIRTUAL (historically known as TELNET, due to usual access assignments), and HFS. The NULL device corresponds to a place where we dump data we don't want; that's <code>/dev/null</code> on all Unices; <code>//./nul</code> on Windows. The NULL device is also known as the "BIT BUCKET", for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>CONSOLE stands for the device the terminal presents itself as if directly connected to a computer. These days, no computer has real console devices. Linux still has an emulated console device: <code>/dev/tty</code>. Cache Terminal presents a console device called <code>|TRM|</code>.</p>
<p>VIRTUAL stands for all connections from Virtual Emulators. Unfortunately every different operating system provides a different console device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: <code>/dev/pts</code> (Use with both Cache and GT.M/YottaDB)</li>
<li>macOS: <code>/dev/ttys</code> (ditto)</li>
<li>Cygwin: <code>/dev/cons</code> (GT.M [no YottaDB port for Cygwin exists])</li>
<li>Cache Telnet: <code>|TNT|</code> (Cache/Windows ONLY)</li>
</ul>
<p>The way set up devices is to edit the DEVICE file in Fileman, the Database Management System for VistA. Unlike most databases in the market, it provides a user interface as well, albeit a text-based one. To get into Fileman, you need to set your user (DUZ) to .5, and then go in.</p>
<h3 id="null-device">NULL Device</h3>
<p>There should only be one device named "NULL". Unfortunately, there are three NULLs of various flavors in the FOIA; we need to make sure there is only one. The following procedure allows you to rename the nulls we don't want, and then delete a synonym.</p>

<h2 id="set-up-taskman">Set-up Taskman</h2>
<p>Taskman is the VistA subsystem that is responsible for running processes in the background.</p>
<p>The first step is to find the box volume pair for the local machine.</p>
<pre>><strong>D GETENV^%ZOSV W Y</strong></pre>
<p>which will print out a message with four parts separated by <code>^</code> that could look something like (Cache):</p>
<pre>VISTA^VISTA^palaven^VISTA:CACHE</pre>
<p>or (GT.M/YottaDB)</p>
<pre>VAH^ROU^Macintosh^ROU:Macintosh</pre>
<p>The four pieces of the string are:</p>
<p><code>UCI^VOL^NODE^VOLUME:BOX</code></p>
<p>The fourth piece, the VOLUME:BOX pair, is referred to as the "BOX VOLUME pair". The first component of the Box Volume pair is the Volume Set, which is used to define the location of routines for the VistA system. The second component, Box, references the system where the instance is found. In a Caché system, it would be the name of the Caché instance; while on GT.M/YottaDB, it should reference the hostname of the machine.</p>
<p>The Volume Set result needs to be altered in the <code>VOLUME SET</code> file, and we will reuse some setup by writing over the name of the first entry that is already in the VistA system. The first entry, the entry with an IEN of 1, can be selected by entering <code>`1</code>.</p>
<p>Then we rename the first Box-Volume pair in the <code>Taskman Site Parameters</code> file to match what was found above.</p>
<p>For this demonstration instance, the Volume Set will be <code>ROU</code>, as per the output above.</p>

<p>If ANY of the fields in the last screen are empty, except "Log Tasks?", you made a mistake. Double check your work.</p>
<p>Next we need to initialize the recurring and start-up tasks that VistA will run. The set of tasks you want your system to run with is very variable; you can see this page for guidance: <a href="http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/Taskman_Recurring_Tasks">http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/Taskman_Recurring_Tasks</a>. We will set these base tasks, which every VistA system ought to have, up on your VistA system:</p>
<p>Start-up Jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>XWB LISTENER STARTER (Starts RPC Broker)</li>
<li>XOBV LISTENER STARTUP (Starts VistALink Broker)</li>
<li>XUSER-CLEAR-ALL (Cleans signed on users for a system that just got booted)</li>
<li>XUDEV RES-CLEAR (Clear resource devices for a system that just got booted)</li>
<li>XMMGR-START-BACKGROUND-FILER (Start mailman background processor)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nightly Jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>XMAUTOPURGE (Delete unreferenced mail messages)</li>
<li>XMCLEAN (Delete from system messages deleted by users)</li>
<li>XMMGR-PURGE-AI-XREF (Delete duplicate network messages)</li>
<li>XQBUILDTREEQUE (Rebuild the menus in the menu system)</li>
<li>XQ XUTL $J NODES (IMPORTANT: Delete left over temp globals from process activity)</li>
<li>XUERTRP AUTO CLEAN (Cleans the error trap after 7 days)</li>
<li>XUTM QCLEAN (Clean Task file from completed tasks if the task didn't delete itself after it ran)</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these tasks, which tasks you run depends on what's important to you: if you write notes, you will want TIU tasks; if you use Drug Accountability, you will want PSA tasks; etc.</p>
<p>FOIA VistA comes with a lot of junk, so I advise starting from a clean slate. Be careful with the next few commands: they should never be run on an existing system, otherwise they may delete patient data:</p>
<pre>><strong>K ^%ZTSK,^%ZTSCH</strong> ; clean taskman Globals
><strong>D DT^DICRW S DIK="^DIC(19.2," F DA=0:0 S DA=$O(^DIC(19.2,DA)) Q:'DA  D ^DIK</strong> ; Delete all tasks</pre>
<p>Next add the tasks outlined above to OPTION SCHEDULING (#19.2). The startup entries will only need the NAME and SPECIAL QUEUING fields; the nightly jobs will need NAME, QUEUED TO RUN AT WHAT TIME, and RESCHEDULING FREQUENCY fields.</p>

<h2 id="setup-your-institution">Setup your Institution</h2>
<p>VistA has a very complex structure to deal with the question of: in what hospital are you signed in right now? The answer determines the value of the all important variable <code>DUZ(2)</code> and the API <code>SITE^VASITE()</code>.</p>
<p>There are five files that are important in that regard: INSTITUTION (#4), STATION NUMBER (TIME SENSITIVE) (#389.9), KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS (#8989.3), MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION file (#40.8), and MASTER PATIENT INDEX (LOCAL NUMBERS) (984.1). We will add our Hospital to the INSTITUTION file first, with the station number 999. Then we will make sure that the STATION NUMBER file says 999; and then will will point the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS and MEDICAL CENTER DIVISION to our new Hospital. In MASTER PATIENT INDEX, we tell it our station number and the range of numbers for our Integration Control Numbers (ICNs), the number used to identify patients across systems.</p>
<p>By default, FOIA VistA comes with station number 050, and the institution is called SOFTWARE SERVICE. We can't leave that alone because VistA malfunctions with station numbers are are just 2 digits long (050 becomes 50 in code).</p>
<p>The INSITUTION file is protected from editing by requiring the variable XUMF to be defined. That tells us that inside of the VA, the file is updated by something called Standard Terminology Services (STS), which works by sending VistA mail messages of what to update, and VistA creates the entry based on that mail message. Normally when you see that, you should stay the hell out of the file: it's standardized and should not be tampered with. However, people outside of the VA have no other way to run VistA without updating this file.</p>
<p>We enter Fileman after setting the XUMF variable. Note that in the US, we are supposed to fill the NPI variable, and Fileman won't let me go further without filling it; but I was able to jump forward to avoid answering it. Also, note that we have to fill the STATION NUMBER entry twice, once in the field named so, and another time in the coding system multiple.</p>
<p>A quick note on FACILITY TYPE: This field is important to idenfity your institution as a Medical facility; if you don't do that, while things mostly work, there will be a few odd items that won't work, like the API to add a patient in <code>ADD^VAFCPTAD</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to check that the broker started. While you may use ^%SS or ^ZSY to find that out, I prefer OS level tools that show me that the port is active.</p>
<p>On Mac or Linux, you can run <code>lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P</code>; on Linux, <code>netstat -tnlp</code>; on Windows (including Cygwin), <code>netstat -aon | find /i "listening"</code>. Here's an example output on a Mac:</p>

<p>If you shut down your system and then bring it back up, starting Taskman using <code>^ZTMB</code> will start your broker, as we set it up as one of the startup tasks.</p>

<p>Independent of our set-up above, we can start the broker at any port we want from direct mode using <code>J ZISTCP^XWBTCPM1(&lt;port no&gt;)</code>.</p>
<p>To test the broker from the client side, you can download the Broker SDK from the FOIA site: <a href="http://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/XWB-RPC%20BROKER/XWB_1_1_P60_scrubbed.zip">http://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/XWB-RPC%20BROKER/XWB_1_1_P60_scrubbed.zip</a></p>

Select NEW PERSON NAME: <strong>&lt;enter&gt;</strong></pre>
<p>Next give your user privileges appropriate for a system manager. This brings us to VistA's security system.</p>
<p>VistA menu tree is built just like the Windows Registry: Folders (known as menus) which contain other folders or actual items which you can run. Each menu is like a door: it has a "key" which locks it; or it could be one of those sliding doors which doesn't have keys. A key to a door (ahem, menu) protects all the subsequent doors beyond the first door. If you lock the first door, you can keep the doors below it open. When we ran <code>DO ^XUP</code>, what we really did was that we went into the menu system.</p>
<p>Keys are also checked by runtime code in order to give privileges when performing certain operations. It's a very common practice in VistA for all users to have access to something, but only the holders of specific keys can perform certain actions. For example, all Lab users have "LRLAB"; but only those credentialed as Lab Technicians will have "LRVERIFY" to release the result.</p>
<p>Let's enlarge our analogy a bit: Users of the VistA system can be assigned a specific door to enter into: This is known as their PRIMARY MENU. A prevalent practice is to give everybody the PRIMARY MENU of <code>XUCORE</code>, which is analogous to a City Portal. Once you say who you are (ACCESS CODE) and your password (VERIFY CODE), you enter the City (XUCORE) and you can only enter the building for which you have the key.</p>
<p>What we do below is a couple of things: We give ourselves the Fileman Access Code (different from ACCESS CODE) of "@", which gives you the equivalent of root privileges in Fileman. Next, we give ourselves the keys <code>XUMGR</code> (let's you add users and manipulate tasks); <code>XUPROG</code> (let's you edit users [don't ask me why--I have no clue why they put that key there], and install Software); <code>XUPROGMODE</code> (let's you enter programmer mode); <code>XMMGR</code> (let's you manage mailman), <code>XUSPF200</code> (let's you add users without requiring an SSN). By the way, privileged users can be given the ability to add new users and assign and take away keys using a mechanism called delegation. I won't cover that here.</p>

<p>Before we go into details of the next screen, let's talk about the &lt;PF1&gt; key. Press &lt;PF1&gt; refers to notations for use of Vista on Terminals. For example, the original VT-320 keyboard had additional character sets and keys which include Find, Select, Insert, Remove, Previous Screen, Next Screen, an arrow cluster and F1 to F20. With Terminal Emulators, the Keys are "mapped", which means when you push a given key it acts as the key would in a terminal. For instance, F1, F2, F3 and F4 are equivalent to the PF1, PF2, PF3 and PF4 keys on the terminal keyboard and Page Up and Page Down on the computer keyboard correspond to Previous Screen and Next Screen. Also there is lots of information about terminals if you are interested at <a href="http://www.vt100.net">http://www.vt100.net</a>. Also, the very beginning of this document tells you what are the recommended terminal emulators to use.</p>
<p>Now you will be presented with a screen with multiple options. You can navigate the screen with the TAB key. For navigation help, use your keyboard arrows to move down to the command line and hold down either the Num Lock key (which is mapped as PF1 of a VT-320 terminal by Caché) or F1 for other terminal emulations and hit "H" and then Enter for help. You can exit by typing "^" on the command line and the change you made will be saved. At a minimum, assign EVE as the PRIMARY MENU and enter IRM (it's the only choice) as SERVICE/SECTION. If you plan to use CPRS, enter OR CPRS GUI CHART as a SECONDARY MENU OPTION. Enter other data as you deem appropriate. If DISUSER or Termination Reason is set, use the '@' to delete both of them. To avoid problems down the road with a division that you didn't set-up, delete the DIVISION (tab to it, then enter, then @) that you see in the screen (unlike the screenshot below). No division means that the user will default to the main division, PALM DESERT HOSPITAL, which we already previously set-up.</p>

Type <code>^</code> to exit.</p>
<p>Now see if you received it. Log on using <code>D ^ZU</code>. At the Systems Manager prompt, type <code>MAILMAN MENU</code>. If you don't see the NEW messages option, it means that you need to navigate to the submenu, and type "MAILMAN" again.

<h2 id="add-cprs-user">Add CPRS User</h2>
<p>The next step is to create a user that can sign on to the CPRS GUI. The things to make sure that this new user has are</p>
<ul>
<li>A Secondary menu option of "OR CPRS GUI CHART"</li>
<li>CPRS Tab Access</li>
<li>An ACCESS CODE</li>
<li>A VERIFY CODE</li>
<li>Service/Section (required for any user)</li>
</ul>
<p>The menu option ensures that the user has the proper permissions to access CPRS after signing in with their ACCESS and VERIFY codes. The Tab access can limit the amount of things a user can access once they have signed in.</p>
<p>The adding of the user is done through the User Management menu in the menu system, which will ask for information in a series of prompts then will open a Screenman form to complete the task.</p>
<p>The following steps will add a generic <code>CPRS,USER</code> person who will be able to sign into CPRS.</p>
<p>From the previous mail message example, exiting out of mailman and pressing enter a couple of times will get you back to the System Manager Menu <code>EVE</code>. If you signed out, go back through the front door using <code>mumps -r ZU</code> (GTM/YDB) or <code>csession &lt;instance&gt; -U &lt;namespace&gt; ZU</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, CPRS can successfully connect to the local VistA instance and the <code>CPRS,USER</code> will be able to sign on and interact with the GUI.</p>
<h2 id="downloading-cprs-and-running-it">Downloading CPRS and Running It</h2>
<p>The next part is laborious and tedious: finding the correct vesion of CPRS to run on your FOIA instance.</p>
<p><em>NB: If you have been following on a Linux or Mac machine so far, you need to switch to Windows or use Wine 1.8 or higher to run CPRS. Earlier versions of Wine had an unimplemented function in comctl32.dll that prevented CPRS from running.</em></p>
<p>The first thing is that you need to go into Fileman, and find out what the version of CPRS you need to use is:</p>
<pre>><strong>S DUZ=1 D Q^DI</strong>


VA Fileman 22.2


Select OPTION: <strong>INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES</strong>  



Output from what File: <strong>19</strong>  OPTION         (10351 entries)
Select OPTION NAME: <strong>OR CPRS GUI CHART</strong>       CPRSChart version 1.0.30.75
Another one: <strong>^</strong></pre>
<p>Okay. So we need <code>1.0.30.75</code>. So we navigate here: <a href="http://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/CPRS%20GUI%20FILES/">http://foia-vista.osehra.org/Patches_By_Application/CPRS%20GUI%20FILES/</a>, and from there, try to guess which version we need. From my version string, it looks like we need version 30. There are three version 30's; so I guess I should choose the latest one.</p>
<p>At this point, we need to look for a .zip file. Looking through the list, I see</p>
<ul>
<li>OR_30_423_scrubbed.zip</li>
<li>OR_30_423_SRC_scrubbed.zip</li>
</ul>
<p>The one most likely to contain the CPRS exe is OR_30_423_scrubbed.zip; SRC_scrubbed.zip is the CPRS source code, which also may contain a compiled version.</p>
<p><em>Please please note that this is what I see when I write this at the end of 2016; what you see in the future will certainly be different.</em></p>
<p>So I download OR_30_423_scrubbed.zip, and open it. There is a CPRSChart.exe in that one. But what version?</p>
<p>We can find that out by right clicking on the exe, choosing properties, and then choosing the 4th tab. Over there, you will see the version number. Make sure that that's the right version number compared with what you have.</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/right_click_on_cprs.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/CPRSPropertiestab0.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/CPRSPropertiestab3.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have the right version, we can try running it, but you will get an error right away saying that 'borlndmm.dll' is needed.</p>
<p>You can find 'borlndmm.dll' in the source code download referenced above (the zip file that contains SRC in the name) in the CPRS-Chart folder. While I am updating these instructions, I found that the 'borlndmm.dll' was actually with CPRSChart.exe. Copy that file to the folder where the CPRSChart.exe is located at.</p>
<p>Now, try to run CPRS again. You will get this splash screen:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/CPRS_Splash_Screen.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>But then, you may see this:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/connection_timeout.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>What you have to do is to invoke CPRS with 3 parameters in order to tell it where and how to connect.</p>
<ul>
<li>s=&lt;ip address or DNS server name&gt;</li>
<li>p=&lt;port&gt;</li>
<li>ccow=disable</li>
</ul>
<p>The way to do that on Microsoft Windows for end users is to create a shortcut and modify the target. Therefore, here's what you need to do: right click on CPRS, and choose "Create Shortcut". You will see a shortcut icon right in the same window. Something that looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/shorcut_icon.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>Right-click on that, and then click (i.e. left click) on properties. You will see the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/shortcut_properties.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>In the target field, append the s, p, and ccow as described above. Here is mine:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\FOIACPRS31a.exe s=192.168.1.181 p=9000 ccow=disable</code></pre>
<p>Click OK. You will see that CPRS connects, and display the access and verify screen:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/VISTASign-on.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, put in the access and verify codes. If you followed along, this would be CPRS1234 and USR.1234.</p>
<p>Once you sign-in, since you are signing in for the first time, you will be asked to change your verify code:</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/CVC.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>Go ahead and change it (no screen shot shown) and then click OK. It will confirm that it changed, and then you will see the patient selection screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<figure>
<img src="images/InitializeVistA/CPRSPatientSelection.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>You should be happy when you reach this point; except that a medical records system is useless without patients.</p>
<h2 id="registering-your-first-patient">Registering your First Patient</h2>
<p>Let's register a patient. Login using the CPRS User we just set-up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NB: On GT.M/YottaDB, patient registration will crash, as it tries to use Cache Specific Code. To fix that, we need to edit some routines. To edit a routine in GT.M/YDB, it's easiest to just edit it on the shell. You will recall that we installed VistA in /var/db/&lt;name&gt;. And we copied all routines into the r directory. edit the code, use an editor (a simple editor to use is nano) and edit the file. For example, to edit MPIFXMLP, enter <code>nano /var/db/&lt;name&gt;/r/MPIFXMLP.m</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to register the patient on GT.M/YottaDB, edit routine MPIFXMLP, changing the label PATIENT to ZPATIENT</p>
<p>In routine DGRPD, in line 34 remove the errant space:</p>
<p><code>N DGSKIP S DGSKIP=$S(DGFORGN:"!,?42,""From/To: """,1:"?42, ""From/To: """)</code></p>
<p>to</p>
<p><code>N DGSKIP S DGSKIP=$S(DGFORGN:"!,?42,""From/To: """,1:"?42,""From/To: """)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can register the patient.</p>
