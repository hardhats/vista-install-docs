<p>If you have reached this point, it means that you have finished <a href="./WardSetup.html">setting up the wards</a>.</p>
<p>This is the last step for configuring a hospital. We will admit two patients to cardiology, and one patient to dermatology; and then show the display in CPRS. We will also show the printout of the Gains and Losses report tomorrow after the task we scheduled runs overnight.</p>
<p>We can register patients at the same time as admitting them; so that simplifies things somewhat. From the same ADT Manager Menu we visited before, we go to the <code>Bed Control Menu</code>. From there, we pick <code>Admit a Patient</code>.</p>
<pre>Select ADT Manager Menu <TEST ACCOUNT> Option: <strong>Bed</strong>  Control Menu
