<p>If you have reached this point, it means that you have finished <a href="./WardSetup.html">setting up the wards</a>.</p>
<p>This is the last step for configuring a hospital. We will admit two patients to cardiology, and one patient to dermatology; and then show the display in CPRS. We will also show the printout of the Gains and Losses report tomorrow after the task we scheduled runs overnight.</p>
<p>We can register patients at the same time as admitting them; so that simplifies things somewhat. From the same ADT Manager Menu we visited before, we go to the <code>Bed Control Menu</code>. From there, we pick <code>Admit a Patient</code>. We will explain a few of the prompts later.</p>

<p>Now, if we open CPRS, we can now see the wards:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/AdmitPatients/patient_selection_with_ward.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>Let's discuss some the prompts:</p>
<pre>ADMITTING REGULATION: <strong>??</strong> 
   When admitting a patient, you must choose an active ADMITTING REGULATION
   which best describes the category under which this patient is being
   admitted.


   Choose from:
   1            ACTIVE PSYCHOSIS                  17.33
   4            OBSERVATION & EXAMINATION         17.45
   5            ACTIVE SERVICE                    17.46(b)
   8            EMERGENCY FOR PUBLIC              17.46(c)(1)
   ...</pre>
<p>That brings up a large amount of items to choose from; these are found in file 43.4. This list is not customizable without some programming.</p>
<pre>TYPE OF ADMISSION: <strong>?</strong> 
     Enter the type of movement for this patient on the date/time entered.
     Transaction types must match and only allowable types can be chosen.
 Answer with FACILITY MOVEMENT TYPE NUMBER, or NAME, or PRINT NAME
 Do you want the entire FACILITY MOVEMENT TYPE List? Y  (Yes)
   Choose from:
   1            DIRECT     ADMISSION     ACTIVE
   2            OPT-NSC     ADMISSION     ACTIVE
   3            OPT-SC     ADMISSION     ACTIVE
   4            A/C     ADMISSION     ACTIVE
   5            TRANSFER IN     ADMISSION     ACTIVE
   6            NON-VETERAN     ADMISSION     ACTIVE
   7            WAITING LIST     ADMISSION     ACTIVE
   8            PBC     ADMISSION     ACTIVE</pre>
<p>This list is customizable from menu option "Edit Bed Control Movement Types" in "ADT System Definition Menu". It is stored in File 405.1.</p>
<pre>SOURCE OF ADMISSION: <strong>??</strong> 
   This field contains the source of admission of the veteran, or
   where he was admitted to the hospital from, i.e. community, other
   facility, etc.


   Choose from:
   1D        VA NURSING HOME CARE UNIT     HOSPITAL
   1E        VA DOMICILLARY     HOSPITAL
   1G        CONTRACT CNH (UNDER VA AUSPICES)     HOSPITAL
   1H        COMMUNITY NURSING HOME NOT UNDER VA AUSPICES     HOSPITAL</pre>
<p>This list is not customizable either without some programming. It's stored in File 45.1.</p>
<p>People who adopt VistA outside of the VA either customize these lists by editing the files directly; or they make front ends that hide the complexity from the users.</p>
<p>Lastly, before we end this topic, let's display some reports after we admitted the patients.</p>
<p>If you go back one level up and go to the <code>ADT Manager Menu</code>, then navigate to <code>ADT Output Reports</code>, you will see a large amount of reports. I ran the Gains and Losses report again after a day has elapsed to show you what the new Gains and Losses report looks like:</p>

</figure>
<figure>
<img src="images/AdmitPatients/gnl04.png" class="align-center" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>If you go to the <code>Inpatient/Lodger Report Menu...</code>, you can run the <code>Inpatient Listing</code> and <code>Inpatient Roster</code> reports. The reports are similar; the Roster is more compact though.</p>
<p>First, the Inpatient Listing:</p>

<p>Inpatient Roster:</p>
