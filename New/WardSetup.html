<p>If you have reached this point, it means that you have finished <a href="./SetMasParameters.html">MAS Parameter Set-up</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been following along, we now have three steps left.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the Wards</li>
<li>Create the Rooms and Beds</li>
<li>Initailize the Gains and Losses System</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="create-wards">Create Wards</h1>
<p>We are going to create two wards to correspond to the two treating specialties we setup in the previous section: 3 West for Cardiology; 3 East for Dermatology.</p>
<p>Important fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>G&amp;L ORDER must be filled; otherwise ADT will crash.</li>
<li>HOSPITAL LOCATION FILE POINTER is silly in that you have to type the same exact entry again to add it to the hospital location file. Don't put a different entry name.</li>
<li>RAI/MDS WARD must be left blank. Filling this will also cause a crash.</li>
<li>The Totals field is saying "count the number of patients here and put them in this category". You can repeat the category in another ward, and from that get a total number of admitted patients within a certain category. The example below shows a total of "Hospital" which will count the totals for the hospital (both wards together). There is a total of Cardiology and a total for Dermatology.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the same <code>ADT System Definition</code> menu, we will pick <code>Ward Definition Entry/Edit</code>.</p>

<p>In VistA, Rooms and Beds are a single entity. In reality, they should just be called "Beds". A room with 3 beds may be labeled as 101-A, 101-B, and 101-C. You may add other characters to help you designate the bed as Male/Female, Luxury vs Shared, etc.</p>
<p>Here we create 3 rooms in each ward. 2 of the rooms have 2 beds each; one has a single bed for a total of 10 beds.</p>

<p>Not covered here, but there is an optional step for you to work on: If you want VistA emails when an event happens, you can set-up mail groups, add yourself to the mail groups, and then attach the mail groups to the bulletins.</p>
<p>Here's a list of bulletins that you can receive:</p>

This option is used to specify the mailgroup you desire specific types of
notification to be made to.  The mailgroup can be one created locally or a
distributed &#39;DG&#39; mailgroup.  If a mailgroup is selected notification concerning
that specific action will be made in the form of a mailman bulletin.  If no
notification is desired for a specific action no mailgroup should be specified.
If you have any questions concerning the purpose of a specific type of
notification enter a question mark at the applicable prompt.
