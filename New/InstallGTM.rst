These instructions are a slightly modified version from the `GT.M Acculturation Workshop <https://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/GT.M%20Acculturation%20Workshop/>`_.

Quick Introduction
------------------
There are more ways to install GT.M than there are for YottaDB, since YottaDB is a fork of GT.M. Either one can be used for VistA implementation.

Using the Installation Script (YottaDB)
---------------------------------------
Follow the instructions at https://yottadb.com/product/get-started/. Note the location where YottaDB was installed, presented after the last step. As an example, mine said: 

::

    YottaDB version r1.10 installed successfully at /usr/local/lib/yottadb/r110

This location will be entered for the variable $gtm_dist in the next section.

Using the Installation Script (GT.M)
------------------------------------

Download the installation script, gtminstall, to install the current GT.M release. Download and execute the latest version of the GT.M installer (currently version 0.13) from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/GT.M%20Installer into a temporary directory, using either a browser or a program such as wget.

Note: depending on your network configuration, the wget command may need environment variables to be set to go through proxy servers, and the sudo command may require the -E option to pass your shell environment to the root process invoked by the sudo.

    <div class="code"><code>$ <strong>mkdir /tmp/tmp</strong>
    $ <strong>cd /tmp/tmp</strong>
    /tmp/tmp$ <strong>wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/GT.M%20Installer/v0.13/gtminstall</strong>
    
    ...
    
    /tmp/tmp$ <strong>chmod +x gtminstall</strong>
    /tmp/tmp$ <strong>sudo ./gtminstall --utf8 default</strong>
    [sudo] password for gtmuser: 
    /tmp/tmp$ <strong>ls -l /usr/lib/fis-gtm</strong>
    total 12
    dr-xr-xr-x 5 root root 8192 Nov 13 10:57 V6.2-000_x86_64
    /tmp/tmp$ <strong>cd</strong>
    $</code></div>


Traditional Technique (GT.M)
----------------------------
These instructions are based on V6.2-000; you can use it or any more recent GT.M release. Download GT.M for 64-bit GNU/Linux on the x86_64 platform from SourceForge to a temporary directory, e.g., /tmp, with the wget program:

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>$ <strong>wget -P /tmp http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/files/GT.M-amd64-Linux/V6.2-000/gtm_V62000_linux_x8664_pro.tar.gz</strong></code></div>


Then create another temporary directory and unpack the contents of the tarball into it. If you installed GT.M using the gtminstall technique, you should already have a /tmp/tmp directory.

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>$ <strong>mkdir /tmp/tmp</strong>
    $ <strong>cd /tmp/tmp</strong>
    /tmp/tmp$ <strong>tar zxf ../gtm_V62000_linux_x8664_pro.tar.gz</strong>
    /tmp/tmp$</code></div> 


Finally, install GT.M in /usr/lib/fis-gtm/V6.2-000_x86_64. Note this MUST be done as root.

.. raw:: html
    
    <div class="code"><code>/tmp/tmp$ <strong>sudo ./configure</strong>
    [sudo] password for gtmuser:

    All of the GT.M MUMPS routines are distributed with uppercase names.
    You can create lowercase copies of these routines if you wish, but
    to avoid problems with compatibility in the future, consider keeping
    only the uppercase versions of the files.
    
    Do you want uppercase and lowercase versions of the MUMPS routines? (y or n) <strong>y</strong>

GT.M is now installed and operational and you are ready to continue to `Install VistA on GT.M/YottaDB <./InstallVistAOnGTM.html>`_.
